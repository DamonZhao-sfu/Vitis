Copy Buffer (C)
===============

This Copy Buffer example demonstrate how one buffer can be copied from another buffer.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** Copy Buffer

**KEYWORDS:** cl::CommandQueue, enqueueCopyBuffer, enqueueWriteBuffer, enqueueReadBuffer, enqueueMigrateMemObjects

EXCLUDED PLATFORMS
------------------

Platforms containing following strings in their names are not supported for this example :

::

xilinx_u200_xdma_201830
xilinx_u250_xdma_201830
::


DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/vector_addition.cpp
   
COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be executed by

::

   ./host <vector_addition XCLBIN>

COMMANDS FOR WINDOWS FLOW
-------------------------

Once the environment has been configured, run the following commands :

::

   cd cmake_build
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DXILINX_XRT=<set xilinx xrt path> -DOCL_ROOT=<set ocl root path>
   cmake --build . --verbose --config Debug --target install

   For Example : 
   cd cmake_build
   cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DXILINX_XRT=C:\Xilinx\XRT -DOCL_ROOT=C:\Xilinx\XRT\ext
   cmake --build . --verbose --config Debug --target install
